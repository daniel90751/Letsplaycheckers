# Letsplaycheckers
This was an inside joke with a friend of mine for an old discord channel that isn't here anymore but I think I can put it anywhere. Had to use Discord API and 
This was made when I was in high schol and I only made it because at the time, as kids are, we thought that was funny. This is the last thing i have that me and my friend have as a rememberance of each other. Hope your doing well Mitchell cheers.
